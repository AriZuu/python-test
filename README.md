This is a simple test application for Pico]OS [micropython][1] port.
It runs on Texas Instruments MSP432 launchpad (using uart console).

You'll be needing following modules in parallel to this to build:

- picoos
- picoos-micro
- picoos-python
- cmsis-ports
- micropython

Working python is also required for build host.
